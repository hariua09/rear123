# layout/prepare/default/420_autoresize_last_partitions.sh
#
# Try to automatically resize active last partitions on all active disks
# if the disk size had changed (i.e. only in migration mode).
#
# When AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS is false, no partition is resized.
#
# When AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS is true, all active partitions on all active disks
# get resized by the separated 430_autoresize_all_partitions.sh script. 
#
# A true or false value must be the first one in the AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS array.
#
# When the first value in AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS is neither true nor false
# only the last active partition on each active disk gets resized.
#
# All other values in the AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS array specify partition device nodes
# e.g. as in AUTORESIZE_PARTITIONS=( /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb3 )
# where last partitions with those partition device nodes should be resized
# regardless of what is specified in the AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS array.
#
# The values in the AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS array specify partition device nodes
# where partitions with those partition device nodes are excluded from being resized.
# The special values 'boot', 'swap', and 'efi' specify that
#  - partitions where its filesystem mountpoint contains 'boot' or 'bios' or 'grub'
#    or where its GPT name or flags contain 'boot' or 'bios' or 'grub' (anywhere case insensitive)
#  - partitions for which an active 'swap' entry exists in disklayout.conf
#    or where its GPT name or flags contain 'swap' (anywhere case insensitive)
#  - partitions where its filesystem mountpoint contains 'efi' or 'esp'
#    or where its GPT name or flags contains 'efi' or 'esp' (anywhere case insensitive)
# are excluded from being resized e.g. as in
# AUTORESIZE_EXCLUDE_PARTITIONS=( boot swap efi /dev/sdb3 /dev/sdc4 )
#
# The last active partition on each active disk gets resized but nothing more.
# In particular this does not resize volumes on top of the affected partitions.
# To migrate volumes on disk where the disk size had changed the user must in advance
# manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear recover".
#
# In general ReaR is not meant to somehow "optimize" a system during "rear recover".
# ReaR is meant to recreate a system as much as possible exactly as it was before.
# Accordingly this automated resizing implements a "minimal changes" approach:
#
# When the new disk is a bit smaller (at most AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE percent),
# only the last (active) partition gets shrinked but all other partitions are not changed.
# When the new disk is smaller than AUTOSHRINK_DISK_SIZE_LIMIT_PERCENTAGE percent it errors out.
# To migrate onto a substantially smaller new disk the user must in advance
# manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear recover".
#
# When the new disk is only a bit bigger (less than AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE percent),
# no partition gets increased (which leaves the bigger disk space at the end of the disk unused).
# When the new disk is substantially bigger (at least AUTOINCREASE_DISK_SIZE_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE percent),
# only the last (active) partition gets increased but all other partitions are not changed.
# To migrate various partitions onto a substantially bigger new disk the user must in advance
# manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear recover".
#
# Because only the end value of the last partition may get changed, the partitioning alignment
# of the original system is not changed, cf. https://github.com/rear/rear/issues/102
#
# Because only the last active (i.e. not commented in disklayout.conf) partition on a disk
# may get changed, things go wrong if another partition is actually the last one on the disk
# but that other partition is commented in disklayout.conf (e.g. because that partition
# is a partition of another operating system that is not mounted during "rear mkrescue").
# To migrate a system with a non-active last partition onto a bigger or smaller new disk
# the user must in advance manually adapt his disklayout.conf file before he runs "rear recover".

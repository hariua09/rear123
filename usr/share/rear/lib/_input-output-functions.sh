# UserInput is a general function that is intended for basically any user input.
#   Output happens via the original STDOUT and STDERR when 'rear' was launched
#   (which is usually the terminal of the user who launched 'rear') and
#   input is read from the original STDIN when 'rear' was launched
#   (which is usually the keyboard of the user who launched 'rear').
# Synopsis:
#   UserInput -I user_input_ID [-C] [-r] [-s] [-t timeout] [-p prompt] [-a input_words_array_name] [-n input_max_chars] [-d input_delimiter] [-D default_input] [choices]
#   The options -r -s -t -p -a -n -d  match the ones for the 'read' bash builtin.
#   The option [choices] are the values that are shown to the user as available choices like if a 'select' bash keyword was used.
#   The option [-D default_input] specifies what is used as default response when the user does not enter something.
#       Usually this is one of the choice values or one of the a choice numbers '1' '2' '3' ...
#       that are shown to the user (the choice numbers are shown as in 'select' (i.e. starting at 1)
#       but the default input can be anything else (in particular for free input without predefined choices)
#       so that e.g. '-D 0' is not the first choice but lets the default input be '0' (regardles of choices).
#   The option '-I user_input_ID' is required so that UserInput can work full automated (e.g. when ReaR runs unattended)
#       via user-specified variables that get named USER_INPUT_user_input_ID (i.e. prefixed with 'USER_INPUT_')
#       so that the user can (as he needs it) predefine user input values like
#           USER_INPUT_FOO_CONFIRMATION='input for UserInput -I FOO_CONFIRMATION'
#           USER_INPUT_BAR_CHOICE='input for UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE'
#           USER_INPUT_BAZ_DIALOG='input for UserInput -I BAZ_DIALOG'
#           (with actually meaningful words for FOO, BAR, and BAZ)
#       that will be autoresponded with the value of the matching USER_INPUT_user_input_ID variable.
#       Accordingly only a valid variable name can be used as user_input_ID value.
#       Different UserInput calls must use different '-I user_input_ID' option values but
#       same UserInput calls in different scripts can use same '-I user_input_ID' option values.
#       It is recommended to use meaningful and explanatory user_input_ID values
#       which helps the user to specify automated input via meaningful USER_INPUT_user_input_ID variables
#       and it avoids that different UserInput calls accidentally use same user_input_ID values.
#       It is required to use uppercase user_input_ID values because the USER_INPUT_user_input_ID variables
#       are user configuration variables and all user configuration variables have uppercase letters.
#   The option [-C] specifies confidential user input mode. In this mode no input values are logged.
#       This means that neither the actual user input nor the default input nor the choices values are logged but
#       the prompt, the actual input, the default value, and the choices are still shown on the user's terminal.
#       In confidential user input mode the actual input coming from the user's terminal is still echoed
#       on the user's terminal unless also the -s option is specified.
#       When usr/sbin/rear is run in debugscripts mode (which runs the scripts with 'set -x') arbitrary values
#       appear in the log file so that the confidential user input mode does not help in debugscripts mode.
#       If confidential user input is needed also in debugscripts mode the caller of the UserInput function
#       must call it in an appropriate (temporary) environment e.g. with STDERR redirected to /dev/null like:
#           { password="$( UserInput -I PASSWORD -C -r -s -p 'Enter the pasword' )" ; } 2>/dev/null
# Result:
#   Any actual user input or an automated user input or the default response is output via STDOUT.
# Return code:
#   The UserInput return code is the return code of the 'read' bash builtin that is called to get user input.
#   When the UserInput function is called with right syntax its return code is 0
#   for any actual user input and in case of any (non empty) automated user input.
#   The return code is 1 when the 'read' call timed out (i.e. when there was no actual user input)
#   so that one can distinguish between an explicitly provided user input and no actual user input
#   even if the explicitly provided user input is the same as the default so that it makes a difference
#   whether or not the user explicitly chose and confirmed that the default is what he actually wants
#   or if he let things "just happen" inattentively via timeout where it is important to have a big timeout
#   so that an attentive user will actively provide user input to proceed even if it is same as the default.
# Usage examples:
# * Wait endlessly until the user hits the [Enter] key (without '-t 0' a default timeout is used):
#       UserInput -I WAIT_UNTIL_ENTER -t 0 -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
# * Wait up to 30 seconds until the user hits the [Enter] key (i.e. proceed automatically after 30 seconds):
#       UserInput -I WAIT_FOR_ENTER_OR_TIMEOUT -t 30 -p 'Press [Enter] to continue'
# * Get an input value from the user (proceed automatically with empty input_value after the default timeout).
#   Leading and trailing spaces are cut from the actual user input:
#       input_value="$( UserInput -I FOO_INPUT -p 'Enter the input value' )"
# * Get an input value from the user (proceed automatically with the 'default input' after 2 minutes).
#   The timeout interrupts ongoing user input so that 'default input' is used when the user
#   does not hit the [Enter] key to finish his input before the timeout happens:
#       input_value="$( UserInput -I FOO_INPUT -t 120 -p 'Enter the input value' -D 'default input' )"
# * Get an input value from the user by offering him possible choices (proceed with the default choice after the default timeout).
#   The shown choice numbers start with 1 so that '-D 2' specifies the second choice as default choice:
#       input_value="$( UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE -p 'Select a choice' -D 2 'first choice' 'second choice' 'third choice' )"
# * When the user enters an arbitrary value like 'foo bar' this actual user input is used as input_value.
#   The UserInput function provides the actual user input and its caller needs to check the actual user input.
#   To enforce that the actual user input is one of the choices an endless retrying loop could be used like:
#       choices=( 'first choice' 'second choice' 'third choice' )
#       until IsInArray "$input_value" "${choices[@]}" ; do
#           input_value="$( UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE -p 'Select a choice' -D 'second choice' "${choices[@]}" )"
#       done
#   Because the default choice is one of the choices the endless loop does not contradict that ReaR can run unattended.
#   When that code runs unattended (i.e. without actual user input) the default choice is used after the default timeout.
# * The default choice can be anything as in:
#       input_value="$( UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE -p 'Select a choice' -D 'fallback value' -n 1 'first choice' 'second choice' 'third choice' )"
#   The caller needs to check the actual input_value which could be 'fallback value' when the user hits the [Enter] key
#   or one of 'first choice' 'second choice' 'third choice' when the user hits the [1] [2] or [3] key respectively
#   or any other character as actual user input ('-n 1' limits the actual user input to one single character).
# * When up to 9 possible choices are shown using '-n 1' lets the user choose one by only pressing a [1] ... [9] key
#   without the additional [Enter] key that is normally needed to submit the input. With an endless loop that retries
#   when the actual user input is not one of the choices it is possible to implement valid and convenient user input:
#       choices=( 'default choice' 'first alternative choice' 'second alternative choice' )
#       until IsInArray "$choice" "${choices[@]}" ; do
#           choice="$( UserInput -I BAZ_CHOICE -t 60 -p 'Hit a choice number key' -D 1 -n 1 "${choices[@]}" )"
#       done
# * To to let UserInput autorespond full automated a predefined user input value specify the user input value
#   with a matching USER_INPUT_user_input_ID variable (e.g. specify that it in your local.conf file) like
#       USER_INPUT_BAR_CHOICE='third choice'
#   which lets a 'UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE' call autorespond with 'third choice'.
#   No USER_INPUT_BAR_CHOICE variable should exist to get real user input for a 'UserInput -I BAR_CHOICE' call
#   or the user can interupt any automated response within a relatively short time (minimum is only 1 second).
